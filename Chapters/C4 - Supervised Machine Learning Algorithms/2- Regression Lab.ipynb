K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**\n","\n","- **Key Idea**: Instead of learning an explicit function, KNN **stores** the training data and **predicts** the target for a new data point by looking at the **average (mean)** of the **k nearest neighbors** in feature space.\n","  \n","- **Use Cases**: Works reasonably well for smaller datasets with low to moderate dimensionality, where a non-parametric approach might capture local patterns better than a global linear model.\n","- **Pros**:  \n","  - Straightforward, intuitive.  \n","  - No real “training” phase, because data is just stored.\n","- **Cons**:  \n","  - Can be **computationally expensive** at prediction time (you have to find neighbors).  \n","  - Performance can degrade as the number of features grows (curse of dimensionality).  \n","  - Sensitive to outliers and scaling of features (it’s often beneficial to scale or normalize your data).\n","\n",">>>![KNN Regression Diagram](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240617141430/download-%2819%29.png)  \n","*Figure: Illustration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression, showing how predictions are made by averaging the k nearest neighbors in feature space.*\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **3.
