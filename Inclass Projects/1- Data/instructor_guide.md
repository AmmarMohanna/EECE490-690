# Instructor Guide: Project 1 - EDA Student Performance

## Teaching Notes

### Session Preparation
- Ensure all students have the required packages installed
- Test the notebook on your system beforehand
- Prepare sample visualizations for the kick-off presentation
- Have backup data ready in case of technical issues

### Key Teaching Points

#### 1. EDA Philosophy (Kick-off)
- **What makes "good" EDA?**
  - Systematic approach (load → inspect → clean → explore → visualize)
  - Clear documentation of findings
  - Actionable insights
  - Reproducible workflow

#### 2. Data Inspection Best Practices
- Always check data types first
- Look for missing values systematically
- Understand the business context
- Document data quality issues

#### 3. Visualization Hierarchy
- Start with distributions (histograms, box plots)
- Move to relationships (scatter plots, correlations)
- End with complex interactions (facet plots, heatmaps)

## Expected Student Solutions

### Mini-Exercise Option A: Non-academic Factors
```python
# Sample solution code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# 1. Gender analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='gender', y='final_grade')
plt.title('Final Grade by Gender')

# 2. Meal habit analysis
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='meal_habit', y='final_grade')
plt.title('Final Grade by Meal Habit')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

# 3. Statistical test
from scipy import stats
male_grades = df[df['gender'] == 'Male']['final_grade']
female_grades = df[df['gender'] == 'Female']['final_grade']
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(male_grades, female_grades)
print(f"Gender difference p-value: {p_value:.4f}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Mini-Exercise Option B: Study Time & Parental Education
```python
# Sample solution code
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# 1. Create pivot table
pivot_table = df.pivot_table(
    values='final_grade', 
    index='parental_education', 
    columns='study_time_band', 
    aggfunc='mean'
)
print("Average Final Grade by Education and Study Time:")
print(pivot_table)

# 2. Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(pivot_table, annot=True, cmap='YlOrRd', fmt='.1f')
plt.title('Average Final Grade by Parental Education and Study Time')
plt.show()

# 3. Interaction analysis
from scipy import stats
# ANOVA test for interaction
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
groups = [group['final_grade'].values for name, group in df.groupby(['parental_education', 'study_time_band'])]
f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(*groups)
print(f"Interaction effect p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

## Common Student Questions & Answers

### Q: "Why do we need to check data types?"
**A**: Data types determine how we can analyze and visualize the data. Categorical variables need different treatment than numerical ones.

### Q: "What's the difference between correlation and causation?"
**A**: Correlation shows relationship, but doesn't prove one causes the other. Always consider confounding variables.

### Q: "How many visualizations should I create?"
**A**: Focus on quality over quantity. Each visualization should answer a specific question or reveal a pattern.

### Q: "What if I find outliers?"
**A**: Document them, investigate their cause, and decide whether to include/exclude based on business context.

## Assessment Criteria

### Excellent (A)
- Complete all notebook sections
- Create insightful visualizations
- Provide clear interpretations
- Identify actionable insights
- Follow best practices

### Good (B)
- Complete most sections
- Create basic visualizations
- Provide some interpretations
- Identify some patterns
- Follow most best practices

### Satisfactory (C)
- Complete basic sections
- Create simple visualizations
- Provide basic interpretations
- Identify obvious patterns
- Follow some best practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Package installation problems**: Provide conda environment file
2. **Memory issues with large datasets**: Use sample data
3. **Plotting errors**: Check matplotlib backend
4. **Encoding issues**: Ensure UTF-8 encoding

### Technical Setup:
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n eda_project python=3.8
conda activate eda_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## Extension Activities

### For Advanced Students:
- Perform statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Create interactive visualizations with Plotly
- Build a simple predictive model
- Analyze feature importance

### For Struggling Students:
- Provide more guided code examples
- Focus on one visualization type at a time
- Use simpler datasets
- Provide more scaffolding

## Feedback Collection

### Post-Session Survey Questions:
1. What was the most challenging part of the EDA process?
2. Which visualization technique was most useful?
3. What insights surprised you most?
4. How confident do you feel about performing EDA on new datasets?
5. What would you like to learn more about?

### Student Presentations:
- Ask students to share their most interesting finding
- Discuss different approaches to the same problem
- Highlight creative visualization techniques
- Address common misconceptions
